# [Kallanum Policeum] üéØ

### Project Description
["KALLANUM POLICEUM" is a 4-player online game where players secretly become a Raja, Police, or Kallan (thief). The project's creative and useless feature is that after a full round of play, it swaps the scores and roles of the Kallan and Police, making skill irrelevant and the outcome hilariously pointless. This creates a polished, fully functional game that cleverly subverts the players' efforts.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Our project solves the profound injustice of skilled players losing games due to bad luck. We've engineered a "Karmic Inversion" system that guarantees fairness by swapping the fates of the hero (Police) and the villain (Kallan) at the end of each round. This ensures that no one can complain about the result, as all effort is rendered beautifully and equitably meaningless.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We solve this grave injustice with our revolutionary, patent-pending Karmic Inversion Engine‚Ñ¢! üë®‚Äçüî¨

Instead of letting chaos and luck ruin friendships, our system ensures perfect, unassailable fairness through a simple, three-step process.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Frontend (Client-Side)
The frontend is what players see and interact with in their web browser. It's built with a combination of core web technologies:

HTML: Provides the fundamental structure of the game, including the different screens (lobby, game, results) and all the buttons and text fields.

CSS: Handles all the visual styling. This includes the "frosted glass" container, the custom fonts (Libre Baskerville for headings and Libre Franklin for body text), the color scheme, and the layout of all elements.

JavaScript (Client-Side): Manages all user interactions on the page. It listens for button clicks, sends messages to the server, and dynamically updates the UI when it receives messages back from the server (like showing new screens or updating the player list).

Backend (Server-Side)
The backend is the central brain of the game, running on a server. It's built using Node.js.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run the game's logic on a server.

Express.js: A minimal web framework for Node.js that helps manage the server and serve the index.html file to players when they connect.

Game Logic: The server is responsible for all critical game functions:

Creating and managing game rooms.

Assigning secret roles (Raja, Mantri, Police, Kallan) to players.

Validating game actions (e.g., ensuring only the Police can guess).

Calculating the actual scores after the Raja's decision.

Real-Time Communication
Instant communication between all players is the most critical technical component.

WebSockets: The core technology that allows for a persistent, two-way connection between each player's browser and the server. This means the server can push updates to players instantly without them needing to refresh the page.

Socket.IO: A popular JavaScript library that makes using WebSockets much simpler. It handles all the complex parts of establishing and maintaining connections, allowing us to send messages with simple commands like socket.emit() (to send) and socket.on() (to listen).

### Implementation
For Software:Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Client-Side)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO (WebSockets)

Fonts: Libre Baskerville & Libre Franklin
